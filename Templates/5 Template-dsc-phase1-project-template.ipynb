    "You and your partner are looking to open a small business and trying to decide the best type of business to open and where is the should be located. You want to base your decision on hard data and decide to use Yelp's API to get data for your analysis. The data for your analysis will come primarily from Yelp's API. The type of businesses and potential markets for your business are to open to your choosing. In your analysis, you can either compare two different types of businesses in the same market (coffee shop vs. gym in Detroit), or one type of business in two different markets (spa in Miami vs LA). The geographical areas that you are comparing can be two cities/towns or, for large cities, it can be two separate parts of that city (Queens vs. BK). You and your partner will decide the criteria for selecting the area to open your business, but it must be based in your data analysis.\n",

    "The Data\n",
    "While your data will primarily come from Yelp, you can augment it with any other data source you feel will help improve your analysis. For example, you can use census data do help determine which market has your target audience. Below is a blog from a former Flatiron student about how to access census data through python. This is just one example of a data source, but you are open to any others you find on your own.\n",
